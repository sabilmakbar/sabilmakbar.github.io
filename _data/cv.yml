  contents:
    - title: Advancing NLP latest models to Indonesian & its local languages
      items:
        - LLM are known to perform poorly in low-resource languages, due to diminishing data volume
        - In addition, some resources of local languages in Indonesia aren't being exploited yet in latest NLP advancement
        - Hence, I'm contributing on a project (with several masterful folks from Indonesia) in carrying this mission
    - title: NLP Generic Toolkit Expansion
      items:
        - "Motivation: Some of the most used NLP toolkits isn't available in Indonesia, yet in its local languages"
        - Hence, I'd like to partake in this mission to democratize the tool & knowledge across languages
    - title: Low-resource NLP Research
      items:
        - There are some Low-resource Languages in Indonesia that is syntacticly transferrable w/o significant semantic degradation from Indonesian languages
        - Hence, I'm dedicated to devote on bridging NLP into low-resource languages by this approach
        - My aspiration also includes attending higher degree education in a environment such that it will enables me on driving this vision

- title: Other Interests
  type: list
  contents:
    - Cracking Math Problems (at times I'm longing for a challenge for proving/disproving a Math statement)
    - Learning to code tidily and in self-explainable manner (since I'm not a CS person during college years, I have to push myself by doing self-learning)
    - Doing a truly end-to-end deployment from the scratch, by my own hands (however I may be assisted by Stackoverflow or ChatGPT)
    - Discovering Mathamatics beauty as a "language" in real-life domain (be it in DS, ML, and AI or in Social Science)
