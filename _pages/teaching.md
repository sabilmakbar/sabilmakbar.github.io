I used to assist student on my second and third year of my degree.

Started as Data Analysis Lab Assistant (for non-Math students), throughout my journey the courses ramped up to some others, i.e Numerical & Computational Math, Intermediate Data Analaysis for Math Student. In addition, I also had experience as Grading Assistant for Calculus and First-year Mathematic Course for non-STEM major in ITB.

In addition, aside from assistantship that I partook in ITB, I also had experiences in doing private teach for students in Calculus, Basic Statistics, and Matrices & Vector Course (super-elementary and counting-only version of Linear Algebra).
