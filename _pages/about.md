<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My name is Salsabil Maulana (or Sabil). I'm a Data Scientist in Tokopedia, one of the largest E-Commerce Company in Indonesia. My work scope covers NLP & IR apspects projects, specifically in Search. Previously, I worked as the first Data Scientist in a Prop-tech Company called Pashouses. I graduated as a Bachelor Grad from Mathematics ITB, class of 2020.

During my tenure in Tokopedia, I've worked on spearheading & enhancing several retrieval modules on prefiltering product assortment as well as Search Content & Personalization based on User & Query behaviour. Aside from that, I also worked on building an Multimodal-based AVM in Pashouses.
